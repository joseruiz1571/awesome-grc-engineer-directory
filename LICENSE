    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
    ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights:

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
   limited to, the following:

   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
      directive); and
   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
   of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
   irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
   Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
   of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
   future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
   worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
   treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
   medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
   whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
   promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
   benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
   Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall
   not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
   any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
   the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's rights under
   applicable law.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
   be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
   Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
   account Affirmer's intent and, if the Waiver is judged invalid or
   ineffective for purposes of any reason, the License shall be judged to
   apply to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and the
   terms of the License shall be binding on Licensees. Further, Affirmer
   hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
   non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license
   to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
   all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
   applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
   any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for
   any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
   advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
   be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Under the License, as to any affected person, Licensees are free
   to (i) copy, publish, display, distribute, transmit and otherwise use
   the Work; (ii) make derivative works; (iii) distribute copies or
   portions of the Work; and (iv) commercially exploit the Work, under the
   condition that such persons comply with the License terms. The License
   terms are binding on Licensees. Licensees are required to include a copy
   of, or the URI for, the License with every copy, distribution or public
   performance of, or otherwise using, the Work. Licensees are also
   required (a) to include a statement that the Work is available under
   the License, and (b) to include a copy of, or the URI for, the License
   with every copy, distribution or public performance of, or otherwise
   using, the Work. No Licensee may impose any restrictions on the
   exercise of the rights granted under the License that are not already
   imposed by applicable law. Any use of the Work not authorized under
   the License or permitted under applicable law is prohibited.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

   a. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
      title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
      the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all
      to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

   b. Affirmer disclaims liability for any damages resulting from the use
      of the Work, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental or
      consequential, including without limitation damages for loss of
      goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
      all other commercial damages or losses, even if Affirmer has been
      advised of the possibility of such damages.

   c. This Disclaimer of Liability is separate from and in addition to
      any limitations of liability in the License or any other agreement
      between Affirmer and any person or entity using or distributing the
      Work, and shall apply to all damages arising out of or relating to
      the Work, even if the Work is found to be defective or negligent,
      and regardless of the basis of liability (whether in contract,
      tort, strict liability, or any other theory).

   d. This Disclaimer of Liability shall not be affected by any other
      limitation of liability in the License or any other agreement
      between Affirmer and any person or entity using or distributing
      the Work.

5. Termination of Rights.

   a. Any Licensee may freely use, modify, distribute, and display the
      Work in accordance with the terms of this License. The License is
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright and related
      rights), worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free.

   b. This License is irrevocable for the duration of the applicable
      copyright and related rights. Once the License is granted, it
      cannot be revoked.

   c. This License does not limit Affirmer's rights to take action to
      prevent or remedy infringement or misuse of the Work.

6. Miscellaneous.

   a. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
      here. Affirmer is responsible for claiming the rights granted under
      this License.

   b. No amendment or modification of this License will be valid or
      binding upon Affirmer unless made in writing and signed by Affirmer.

   c. This License may not be modified except by a written instrument
      signed by both parties.

   d. In the event any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions
      shall remain in full force and effect.

   e. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
      the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Work was first published,
      without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

7. Disclaimer of Liability.

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENT
   BETWEEN AFFIRMER AND ANY PERSON OR ENTITY USING OR DISTRIBUTING THE
   WORK, THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND AFFIRMER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
   WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
   NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ABSENCE OF DEFECTS OR WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES THAT
   MAY ARISE OTHERWISE OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OF
   THE WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
