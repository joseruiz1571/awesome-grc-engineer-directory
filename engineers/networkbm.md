## About Me

My name is Brian Montiel, and I’ve been working as a Security Analyst at a 3PAO for the past three years. I’m passionate about learning more about hacking, cloud security, and continuously improving my coding skills. I was brought into the GRC space right after graduating, and since then, I’ve really enjoyed building projects that help make GRC more automated and efficient.

Currently, I’m working on improving my FedRAMP KSI Trust Center demo application. The core functionality is there, but I’m focused on making it more welcoming and visually engaging by adding a more creative touch.

I’m especially interested in cloud security and finding better ways to automate processes to make cloud environments as secure as possible. A lot of my work involves building demos and tools that help showcase and support that goal.


## Experience Highlights

I have created multiple GRC projects and projects just to improve my coding abilities. Additionally, I have written multiple Hackthebox walkthoughts that can be found in my Medium page.
